        "question": "What makes Jessup Cellars wines special?",
        "answer": "Jessup Cellars wines are carefully crafted with the help of our renowned consulting winemaker Rob Lloyd who famously crafted Chardonnay for Rombauer, La Crema and Cakebread.

        "question": "What white wines does Jessup Cellars offer?",
        "answer": "Our leading white wine is our Napa Valley Chardonnay from the Los Carneros region. The Truchard Vineyard is perfectly located in the hills above Highway 12 with the San Francisco Bay influences creating a cooler growing climate where the grapes ripen slowly and perfectly on the vine. The perfect weather combines with an ideal terroir to create the foundation for a well-balanced Chardonnay aged for 10 months in 40% new American Oak barrels. We also offer an annual harvest of Sauvignon Blanc which is sourced from North Coast vines outside of the Napa Valley. The tropical nature of our 2023 Sauvignon Blanc is decidedly different than the typical Sauvignon Blanc grown in the Valley and elsewhere in the World. Due to its limited supply this wine sells out quickly each year so be sure to give us a call before visiting our tasting room to check availability."

        "question": "Can you tell me more about your 2022 Chardonnay?",
        "answer": "The Jessup Cellars 2022 Chardonnay is a white wine that comes across as very well balanced due to the aging being done in a combination of 40% new American and 60% neutral American Oak. This brings hints of oak to the wine while also offering a slightly creamy mouth feel without being a butter bomb. Our Napa Valley Chardonnay is a member favorite while the non-member price of $55 is appreciated by enthusiasts of this quality wine crafted by Rob Lloyd. The alcohol content is 14.8% while the PH is 3.4."

        "answer": "Our 2023 vintage is 100% Sauvignon Blanc sourced from North Coast vineyards aged in 100% stainless steel barrels which is typical for this varietal. The stainless steel seals out the oxygen and seals in the flavors of the fruit and is a hearty 15.1% alcohol content with a PH of 3.3. While it's nose and flavors hint at tropical delights, we would not consider this wine to be too fruit forward, but rather fruit balanced with hints of pineapple and mango. Our Sauvignon Blanc is the perfect hot tub wine or for those warm summer evenings after a long day in the hot summer Sun. You will feel refreshed after enoying a glass or two of our Sauvignon Blanc, non-member price of $45!\n\nThe 2023 Sauvignon Blanc pairs wonderfully with a variety of dishes, enhancing the dining experience. For starters, it complements the flavors of Grilled Prawn Cocktail and Ceviche, accentuating the seafood's delicate taste and brightening the citrus elements in the dishes. The wine's fruity and floral notes beautifully complement the freshness of Tacos, making it an ideal match for this flavorful and versatile Mexican dish. Lastly, the wine's high acidity and fruit-forward character provide a delightful contrast to the creamy sweetness of a Peach & Burrata salad, creating a harmonious and memorable pairing."

While it is 96.7% Pinot Noir with fruit sourced from our favorite Los Carneros Truchard Vineyard, our master winemakers blend in a little (3.3%) of our own Petite Sirah from our estate vineyard in the Wooden Valley area of Southeastern Napa County and age it in 50% new French oak for 10 months The alcohol content of this vintage is 14.8% with a PH of 3.45.This gives our 2021  Pinot Noir a much bolder color, very different from your typical light and bright Pinot you may be accustomed to.

The terroir is ideally suited for a full bodied Merlot and like many of our wines, our Merlot is reflective of the 'Art of the Blend' by our winemakers. The 2019 Merlot is 80% Merlot, 16.5% Cabernet Sauvignon from the Chiles Valley AVA in Northeastern Napa County and a splash of our Petite Sirah (3.5%) from the same location finishes the wine perfectly. Our merlot is aged for 22 months in 40% new American/French oak with an alcohol content of 15.1% with a PH level of 3.55. This wine drinks well now, however, will continue to age gracefully for another 5-8 years.  We recommend trying this delicious Merlot with roasted chicken and vegetables or beef bourguignon.

        "answer": "Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon is a staple of most Napa Valley winemakers with Jessup offering our 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon for 2024. As with most of our red wines, our winemakers exercise 'The Art of the Blend' by starting with 90% Napa Valley fruit from the Chiles Valley AVA in Northeastern Napa County, then blend in 5% Petite Sirah from the same AVA, 3% Merlot from our Truchard Vineyard in the Los Carneros region, then finish it with 2.1% Cabernet Franc, which is the parent grape of both Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, often used in blended wines. Cabernet Franc originated in the Bordeaux region of France and to honor that provenance, we age our 2019 Jessup Cellars Cabernet Sauvignon in 80% new French oak for 22 months. Alcohol content in this varietal is14.9% with a PH of 3.65. You can purchase our 2019 Cab for $90.\n\nThe palate of the wine matches the aromatics providing juicy fruit flavors, rich tannins and a long finish.

This wine has a very different nose and mouth feel than our 2019 Cabernet, presenting a dry, more tannic finish which still feels young but full bodied as it crosses your palate. You could lay this bottle down for another 5-8 years as you wait for it to soften, but if you want to drink it now, we encourage you to pair this wine with a nice Filet Mignon or other red meat.

    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Solera method of dessert wine creation?",
        "answer": "The Solera method is a traditional aging and blending process commonly used in the production of fortified wines, including dessert wines like Sherry and Madeira. Here's how it works:\nTiered Stacking: The process begins with a series of barrels or casks arranged in a tiered system called a \"solera stack.\" The bottom row contains the oldest wine, while subsequent rows contain progressively younger wines.\nFractional Blending: Each year, a portion of wine is drawn from the bottom row of barrels for bottling. This creates space in those barrels, which are then topped up with wine from the row above. The process continues up the stack, with each barrel being partially emptied and then replenished with younger wine.\nAging and Maturity: Because the barrels are only partially emptied each year, a portion of the older wine always remains in the barrels, contributing to the complexity and depth of flavor. Over time, the younger wines gradually blend with and inherit characteristics from the older wines.\nConsistency: The Solera method ensures consistency in the final product, as the blend of wines remains relatively constant over time. Even though some wine is removed for bottling each year, the overall character of the solera remains consistent due to the blending of older and younger wines.\nPerpetual Process: The Solera system is designed to be perpetual, with new wine continuously added at the top and matured wine drawn from the bottom for bottling. This allows producers to maintain a consistent product while also ensuring that some of the original wine remains in the solera stack, sometimes for many years or even decades.\nOverall, the Solera method is a meticulous and time-honored process that results in complex, well-balanced dessert wines with layers of flavor and aroma."
